*Task 1*

Examine these abstracts and answer the following questions.

Is each a clear example of specific type of abstract? Which kind?         
How closely does each abstract conform to conventional guidelines/readers' expectations?         
Can you easily locate

- The objectives of the research?
- The key words identifying the methods used?
- The results of the research?
- The conclusions drawn from the results?
- What could you do to improve each abstract?

*Task 2*

Skim each of these abstracts and cross out all the language that describes the research prject, in particular. The resulting phrases are "shared language' and can be incorporated into your own writing without fear of plagiarism.

*Task 2*

Find out whether these guidelines are suitable for writing a thesis abstract in your discipline. If not, consult with colleagues in your department and create preparation guidelines that you will be able to use when you are writing up your thesis/dissertation.
