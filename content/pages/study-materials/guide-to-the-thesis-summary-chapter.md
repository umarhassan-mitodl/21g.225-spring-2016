1.  Remember that the summary must stand alone. Think of it as a completely separate paper. Avoid excessive allusion to figures and tables in the body of the report and repeat citations of key references.
2.  The organization typically repeats that of the body of the thesis.
3.  Repeat figures, tables or equations from the body of the thesis if they provide particularly succinct condensations of the results. consider using simplified versions which focus on essential findings.
4.  The summary usually ends with a reiteration of the major conclusions and recommendations for future work.
5.  Spend the time necessary to prepare a good summary. Try not to exceed twenty pages of text.
6.  Keep in mind Pascal's analogy to friend: "I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it short."
